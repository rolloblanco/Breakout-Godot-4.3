## Breakout
Made for the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/) in Godot with C#.
Comes with a basic main menu and randomised block placement every time the game scene is ran.

Uses paddle/ball/block assets from [AlixBarreau's Breakout project](https://github.com/AlixBarreaux/simple-breakout).
